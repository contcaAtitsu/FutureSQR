/*
 * For the diff I would like to test, whether building the diff via 
 * BytePairEncoding is able to provide some readability.  
 *
 * I calculated some BPE tables for a general java corpus, some time back.
 * i think i will use them for testing - since i wrote that in python, i
 * should go for a jupyter notebook first and then and only then for a
 * javascript implementation, which is also temporary?
 * you can find the 10k token BPE dataset in the FluentGenesis-Classifier
 * project and also an encoder for this. ( which is actually quite slow... )
 * but i would say, it is god enough right now.
 * 
 * time for some experiments offline....
