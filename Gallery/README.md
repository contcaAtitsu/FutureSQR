Here are a few screen shots of the project after about 24 weeks of coding it in my spare time. There is no artwork, 
neither are there some icons right now. I just wanted to make this thing work in the first place. Instead of 
cluttering the UI with icons and features, this approach is quite the opposite - remove as much as possible.
Because the more features we can remove, the earlier this tool becomes usable.

### (very simple) Side by Side comparison
