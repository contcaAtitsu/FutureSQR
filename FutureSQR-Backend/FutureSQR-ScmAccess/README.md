# FutureSQR-ScmAccess

This project implements a basic access to GIT and later also for SVN, based on the command line tools to 
avoid licensing issues. This part may be replaced, in case we find some useful MIT compliant framework.
Until then, I really want to get things to be done, this is why I don't care for another/better solution
right now. Better solutions can be implemented, when they are actually needed.
