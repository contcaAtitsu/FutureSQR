# Review Performance

A very simple code-review and very small should be perfectly do-able in one or two minutes of 
effort at most. That means we want to create a review from a revision, attach yourself, view
the diff, mark it as approved and close that review.

A code review is nothing special, we don't want friction on this task, because 
creating the review is a necessity, additional revisions shall be easy to find and easy to attach 
in bulk.

So the usability is the most important aspect and the interface should be as understandable as 
possible.
