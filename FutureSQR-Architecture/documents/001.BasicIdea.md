# Basic Idea behind FutureSQR

## FutureSQR is a Code Review System

FutureSQR stands for "Future Source Quality Review"-System and FutureSQR is the working title of this project.

## Why yet another Code Review System

Recent Code Review Systems are built around GIT and its feature-branch and its pull-request model only, as
if there were no other ways to collaborate and also no other ways to integrate changes.
 
In an corporate environment there exists different incentives and alignments, which basically are managed 
by the work contract under which the particular contributor is working.

## Target Audience of this Code Review System

The target audience for this Code Review System are organizations who are following trunk based development
principles and are reviewing source code post commit. Even though GIT seems currently to be quite popular it
is not the only important SCM available. The second most important system to be supported is SVN.

## Processes by Convention not by Force

Different organizations follow different processes for different reasons. A review system forcing a particular
review process will cause a lot of pain for organizations which must follow their procedures - but still want
a code review system. A tool which forces one particular process on its users, it will not be widely adopted.
