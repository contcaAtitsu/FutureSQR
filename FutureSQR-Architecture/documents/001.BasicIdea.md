# Basic Idea behind FutureSQR

## FutureSQR is a Code Review System

FutureSQR stands for "Future Source Quality Review"-System and FutureSQR is the working title of this project.

## Why yet another Code Review System

Recent Code Review Systems are built around GIT and its feature-branch and its pull-request model only, as
if there were no other ways to collaborate and also no other ways to integrate changes.
 
In an corporate environment there exists different incentives and alignments, which basically are managed 
by the work contract under which the particular contributor is working.
