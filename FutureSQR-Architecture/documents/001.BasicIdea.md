# Basic Idea behind FutureSQR

## FutureSQR is a Code Review System

FutureSQR stands for "Future Source Quality Review"-System and FutureSQR/FutureSQuaRe is the working title of this project.
FutureSQR is pronounced "FutureSQuaRe".

## Why yet another Code Review System

Recent Code Review Systems are built around GIT and its feature-branch and its pull-request model only, as
if there were no other ways to collaborate and also no other ways to integrate changes.
 
In a corporate environment there exists different incentives and alignments, which are basically managed 
by the work contract under which the particular contributor is working.

## Target Audience of this Code Review System

The target audience for this Code Review System are organizations who are following trunk based development
principles and are reviewing source code post commit. Even though GIT seems currently to be quite popular it
is not the only important SCM available. The second most important system to be supported is SVN.

Trunk based development allows Continuous Integration on different levels. All developers work on the truth,
for their particular project and the CI-BuildSystem always builds and tests this truth and also the bigger
truths as well.

## Processes by Convention not by Force

Different organizations follow different processes for different reasons. A review system forcing a particular
review process will cause a lot of pain for organizations which must follow their procedures - but still want
a code review system. A tool which forces only one particular process on its users, will not be widely adopted.
Processes always have some advantages and disadvantages and selecting a tool is always a trade-off with respect
to the organizational structure and organizational communication. Something as insignificant as a code review
system will not be allowed to dictate organizational processes. If a tool dictates a process on a organization,
this organization will pay for this kind of compromise with more inefficiency and therefore with money, making 
such an organization less competitive - Why should anyone use such a tool? A tool should provide a benefit to 
an organization not additional friction.
