# Access to FutureSQR

There might be different ways to access a code review tool. Either by integrating it to the 
development environment or by providing some point of access where people visit a web-site.

Integrating it into a particular development environment comes with special problems, the
API can change, the development of the development environment is dropped, or the development
environment it is not suitable for a certain product, or for some other reasons, like that
the tool is not any more updated and doesn't receive security patches, or doesn't support 
new languages or new language features.

## Web-Application

The most universal access, with well understood development methods are web-applications,
usually only a central instance of the software needs to be deployed and maintained. Maybe 
this can be combined with a docker-container based setup, such that the configuration and
the data are separate from the server-software.

Why this should be a Web-Application

* concept of a web-application is familiar
* can be accessed through Browser
* can be transport-secured by SSL and Certificate Pinning 
* using open standards HTTP(S), HTML, e.g. EcmaScript, WebSockets, 
* SessionManagement in Browser
* horizontally scalable
* Usable from different Client-OSes. So reviews can be done from a windows machine, 

## User

This Tool should provide user level access. Only authenticated and authorized users should be
able to view reviews.

A user should be a part of a group, who can see the projects which are assigned to this group
or the user.

But it is not important that the user is automatically authenticated. At the very basic, 
implementation a simple password based authentication scheme is enough. The authentication
scheme should be configurable and extendible for corporate needs.

## Groups

a simple group based authorization scheme is enough to start with. The authorization scheme
should be configurable and extendible for corporate needs.

## ACLs

That might be later implemented, that's what is most simple should be implemented first.
The easier the better.

## REST API must be secured as well

In case we implement a rest API, the rest API should be secured as well.
