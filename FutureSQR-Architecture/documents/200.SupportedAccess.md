# Access to FutureSQR

There might be different ways to access a code review tool. Either by integrating it to the 
development environment or by providing some point of access where people visit a web-site.

Integrating it into a particular development environment comes with special problems, the
API can change, the development of the development environment is dropped, or the development
environment it is not suitable for a certain product, or for some other reasons, like that
the tool is not any more updated and doesn't receive security patches, or doesn't support 
new languages or new language features.

## Web-Application

The most universal access, with well understood development methods are web-applications,
usually only a central instance of the software needs to be deployed and maintained. Maybe 
this can be combined with a docker-container based setup, such that the configuration and
the data are separate from the server-software.

Why this should be a Web-Application

* concept of a web-application is familiar
* can be accessed through Browser
* can be transport-secured by SSL and Certificate Pinning 
* using open standards HTTP(S), HTML, e.g. EcmaScript, WebSockets,
* SessionManagement in Browser
* horizontally scalable
* Usable from different Client-OS'es
* This infrastructure usually works out of the box in most organizations  

## REST-API

The second most universal access nowadays is a restful interface, which can be used to 
perform certain automated tasks, like collecting data for reporting.

Which one in particular, is not yet decided.
