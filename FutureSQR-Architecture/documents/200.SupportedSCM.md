# Supported SCMs

# Most important SCMs

The most important SCMs (Source Code Management Systems) in use for me are SVN and GIT. Both have their 
advantages, but solve different kind of issues.

SVN allows for an additional Configuration Management, which then itself is also under version control.
And in some cases it is important for legal reasons, that a continuous and central version numbering is
provided.

The first two supported Systems must be (in this particular order)
* SVN (is the system with the largest code base for us)
* GIT 

and may be followed by other systems as well.
