# Authentication

Most common modes of authentication should be available

## Username + Password + User and Password Database (MVP)

The first and most easy solution is to manage a simple user to password database. Passwords should be
stored encrypted.

## Other modes 

Other modes are welcome as well, but can wait until proper/substantial progress is made with respect 
to the implementation of this tool - if someone wants to implement these pleasem go ahead.

* Some which come to my mind are:

  * LDAP(S) Authentication / ActiveDirectory - LDAP(S) - Authentication
  * TOTP (RFC6238 + RFC4226)
  * SAML
  * OAuth (RFC 8693)

## Rest API?
  * Authentication Tokens
