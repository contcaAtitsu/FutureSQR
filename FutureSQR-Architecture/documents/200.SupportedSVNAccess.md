# How to Access SVN

The two most important access modes are password based access and client authentication certificate
based access. For the current demands a certificate based access is the most important thing to 
implement.

## SVN-Server Configuration

* Server URL
* Username for server
* Client Certificate for server + username

* simple authentication might be useful for development purposes with username and password

* It would be nice to use some os based credential store, to perform the authentication, but if too complicated another solution must be found.


## SVN-Local repository

But the most simple thing is to first completely ignore remote repositories and to use a local repository to 
access all the version information.
