# What FutureSQR is not

The aim of this system is to provide a system for manual source code reviews, which are usually part 
of other processes.

## Does not provide Static Code Analysis

Other tools like SonarQube provide a better view and integration for static code analyis and their
results into the IDE, if requied.

This System will not implement things like static code analysis. 

* The code should be readable by humans, therefore it is about humans talking about human readable code
* If a static code analysis is provided, it will distract the reviewer and the submitter of the code review from the actual goal, to make source code more readable.
* Code Reviews should provide an additional value to the code, because time is spend to review the source code
* Providing results from static code analysis, will make the reviewers less likely to provide value, but instead point to the SCA-results
* Code Reviews should should allow for knowledge transfer, therefore mixing it with SCA-results, will lead to talks about the wrong things
