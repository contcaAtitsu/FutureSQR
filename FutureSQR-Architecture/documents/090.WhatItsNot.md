# What FutureSQR is

The aim of this system is to provide a tool for manual source code reviews, which are usually part 
of other processes.

# What FutureSQR is *Not*

## Does *not* provide Static Code Analysis

Other tools like "SonarQube" (to name at least one) provide a better view and integration for static 
code analysis and their results into an IDE, if required. There are better tools out there and there
are at least a dozen of them - supporting these will bloat this project and bind valuable developer
resources. But there is an even more profound reason.

We don't want to duplicate these tools, because FutureSQR is about discussing source code changes and
source code - and keeping track of these discussions. 

This System will not implement things like static code analysis for different reasons, it is considered
counter productive. Doing code reviews is a process which obviously costs time and therefore money. A
code review must provide an additional benefit for the reviewed source code, because it costs money.

* The code should be readable by humans, therefore it is about humans talking about human readable code
* Code is written once but it is many times read by humans
* Code Reviews should provide an additional value to the code (e.g. easier to read)
* If a static code analysis data is provided, it distracts the reviewers and the submitters of the code from the actual goal, to make source code more readable
* Providing results from static code analysis, will also make the reviewers less likely to provide additional value, but instead point to the SCA-results ("Boy, should have fixed that")
* Code Reviews should allow for knowledge transfer, therefore mixing it with SCA-results, will lead to discussions about the wrong things at the wrong time
* A Code Review Tool is not about enforcing social or company norms where your colleague is there to control you
* If there are norms about static code quality, it is a matter of course, that these norms are followed and don't require enforcement by colleagues 

## Is not a source code browser

This tool is not a source code browser nor a source code search engine. Thinks like this are complicated
enough and should not be part (of the first iterations) of a code review system.
