# How to access Gitlab repositories

For our demands we use gitlab for administration of the git repositories.

## Git-Server Configuration 

* Server URL
* user per server
* token / certificate / password?
* one or multiple Git_URIs per "project"
* default things like master/main must somehow be configurable

TODO: 
* Must figure out, which mode of access we actually use for authentication and authorization with respect to gitlab
* Must figure out, how the server certificate chain can be handled

## GIT-Local

But the most simple thing is to first completely ignore remote repositories and to use a local repository to 
access all the version information.
