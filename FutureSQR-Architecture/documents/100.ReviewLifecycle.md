# The Code Review LifeCycle

## Review-Life-Cylce over Review-Process

A code review on a technical level should not be developed around a certain process in mind. Processes
change, conventions change, the scope changes, but in any case a code review tool should easily adapt
to the new situation. It should adapt by, having not to change the code review tool at all. That is low
effort and very flexible.

## Four States Of a Code-Review

* Non-existent
* Open
* Closed
* Deleted

A code review may not exist, it may be open, it may be closed, or it was deleted. These four states
will perfectly fit into any process you like. It doesn't need to be more complex nor more detailed 
than this.
