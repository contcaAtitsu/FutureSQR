<h1>Welcome to {{activeProjectID}}:{{activeRevisionID}}</h1>
<p>revision works!</p>

<div>
We want some status information about this particular revision here.<br/>
<br/>
Next thing is that we need a link <a [routerLink]="['/', activeProjectID]"> back to the project</a>.<br/>
<br/>
</div>

<div>
what basically follows is a list of files and paths changed in this revision. <br/>
<br/>
And maybe some fast small diff for each file
</div>
